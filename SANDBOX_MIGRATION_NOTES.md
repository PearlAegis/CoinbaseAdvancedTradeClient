# Sandbox Migration Notes

## Migration Status: Complete âœ…

The embedded sandbox (`CoinbaseAdvancedTradeClient.SandboxTests`) has been successfully migrated to a standalone solution.

## New Standalone Sandbox Repository

**Repository**: [CoinbaseAdvancedTradeClient-Sandbox](https://github.com/PearlAegis/CoinbaseAdvancedTradeClient-Sandbox)

**Key Features**:
- Modern .NET 9.0 Blazor Server architecture
- NuGet package consumption of CoinbaseAdvancedTradeClient v0.2.0
- Kubernetes-ready with path-based routing
- Health check endpoints for container orchestration
- Comprehensive documentation and development guides

## Benefits of Standalone Approach

### For Library Development
- **Cleaner codebase**: Main library no longer carries sandbox dependencies
- **Faster builds**: Reduced solution complexity and build time
- **Clear separation**: Library development vs. testing/demo concerns separated
- **Package testing**: Validates actual NuGet package consumption

### For Sandbox Users
- **Production ready**: Container and Kubernetes deployment support
- **Modern architecture**: Latest .NET 9 Blazor conventions and best practices
- **Better documentation**: Comprehensive setup and development guides
- **Independent versioning**: Sandbox can evolve without affecting library

## Migration Timeline

- **2025-01-11**: Migration planning and analysis completed
- **2025-01-11**: Fresh Blazor Server solution created with .NET 9.0
- **2025-01-11**: Component restructuring with Parts/Pages organization
- **2025-01-11**: Account management functionality migrated and tested
- **2025-01-11**: Documentation and deployment configuration completed
- **2025-01-11**: Pull request created for standalone sandbox

## Next Steps

### For Main Library
1. **Remove embedded sandbox** once standalone version is validated
2. **Update documentation** to reference new standalone sandbox
3. **Clean up solution** by removing SandboxTests project
4. **Update CI/CD** to exclude sandbox from library builds

### For Standalone Sandbox
1. **Complete component migration** (Orders, Products, WebSockets)
2. **Add container support** (Dockerfile, Kubernetes manifests)
3. **Implement deployment automation** (scripts, CI/CD)
4. **Expand API testing features** for full endpoint coverage
